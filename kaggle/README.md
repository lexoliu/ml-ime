# Kaggle kernels

The scripts that ran on Kaggle, pulled back with `kaggle kernels pull -m` after the
run so the repository holds what actually executed. Each directory is one kernel:
`kernel.py` is the script and `kernel-metadata.json` its mounts and machine, as
`kaggle kernels push -p <dir>` expects them.

| kernel | what it did |
|---|---|
| `labels-v1` | g2pW labels for the run3 v1 subset, one of three kernels splitting the shards (`KERNEL_INDEX` of `KERNEL_COUNT`) |
| `route-a-v1` | the first full route A run, 2×T4, one epoch, then the eval3 lattice scored with context on and off |
